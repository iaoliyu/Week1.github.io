        <dd>The group held a meeting at 1:30 p.m. on August 23, this meeting aimed at determining the theme of the graduation design project, providing three alternatives for discussion, as well as the finalized project theme and project division.


<dd>
1. ** Alternative: **

- Underwater Shipwreck Hull Opening and Pumping System Design.

- Research on key technology of serpentine robotic arm sweeping for acoustic leakage detection of gas pipelines.

- Industrial robotic arm trajectory planning and application based on improved SSA algorithm.


<dd>
2. ** Project theme determined: **

After in-depth discussion and comprehensive evaluation of alternatives, the meeting finally decided to choose "Underwater Shipwreck Hull Opening and Pumping System Design" as the theme of the graduation design project. This program will explore and innovate in multiple areas, providing rich academic and practical opportunities for team members.


<dd>
3. ** Project division: **

Finally, the meeting decided to divide the project into the following five key parts to ensure the smooth progress and high quality of the project:

- ** Opening Equipment: ** This section will focus on the design and development of opening equipment for underwater shipwrecks.

- ** Automation Equipment: ** This section deals with solutions and technologies related to automation equipment.

- ** Manipulator motion planning: ** Manipulator motion planning and control will be a key component of the project.

- ** Flow field simulation and Surgical Shell design: ** This section will focus on flow field simulation and surgical shell design to ensure system stability and efficiency.

- ** Manipulator end effectors: ** The final part of the project will focus on the development and optimization of the manipulator end effectors.


<dd>
With this detailed project division, we expect to ensure that each part is given full attention and carefully designed so that the project can be successful and provide valuable academic and professional experiences for team members.



At the end of the meeting, the participants expressed unanimous support for the selection and division of the project and looked forward to working together in future work to achieve the successful completion of the project.
